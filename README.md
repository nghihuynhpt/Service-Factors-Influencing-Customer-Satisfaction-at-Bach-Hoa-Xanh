# Service Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction at Bach Hoa Xanh

This group project was conducted as part of a Marketing Research course to identify the key service factors influencing customer satisfaction at Bach Hoa Xanh. The goal was to provide the Marketing team with actionable insights to improve service offerings, based on an in-depth analysis of survey data.

My responsibilities included:
* Defining the research objectives.
* Developing the survey questionnaire for three variables: Empathy, Responsiveness, and Satisfaction, using a Likert scale.
* Testing the relationship between pairs of qualitative variables:
  * Gender and Purchase Frequency / Average Monthly Spending / Most Frequently Purchased Item.
  * Purchase Frequency and Average Monthly Spending / Most Frequently Purchased Item.
  * Average Monthly Spending and Most Frequently Purchased Item.
(These relationships were examined using Crosstabulation and Chi-square tests to determine dependency. A p-value less than the significance level indicated a relationship between the variables.)
* Proposing future research directions to enhance the representativeness and accuracy of the study's findings.

* Data was collected from student [survey](https://ntlink.co/BHX-survey) forms in Ho Chi Minh City.
* **Tool used:** SPSS.
